%global common_description %{expand:
Hedley is a single C/C++ header you can include in your project to enable
compiler-specific features while retaining compatibility with all compilers. It
contains dozens of macros to help make your code easier to use, harder to
misuse, safer, faster, and more portable.

You can safely include Hedley in your public API, and it works with virtually
any C or C++ compiler.}
