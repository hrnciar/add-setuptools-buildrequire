%description
DiskCache is an Apache 2 licensed disk and file backed cache library,
written in pure-Python, and compatible with Django. The cloud-based
computing of 2019 puts a premium on memory. Gigabytes of empty space 
is left on disks asprocesses vie for memory. Among these processes is
Memcached (and sometimes Redis) which is used as a cache. Wouldn't it 
be nice to leverage.
